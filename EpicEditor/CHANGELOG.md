## v0.2.2.1 (August 20, 2013)
- Version 0.2.2.1 is the initial release of EpicEditor *for Rails*. This version simply adds EpicEditor to the asset pipeline.

## (June 25, 2016)
- This is a clone of the AJALabs EpicEditor *for Rails* gem. I renamed a few folders and files from epiceditor to epic_editor to resolve Rails 4.2.5 production environment naming issues.
