# Blocipedia
A SaaS app that allows users to create their own wikis, label them, and add collaborators (other users) to them.
The wikis support markdown and include an editor that allows a markdown preview to view while writing.

The application runs on Ruby 2.2.1 and Rails 4.2.5. Please view the gemfile for application dependencies. The application uses SQLite for development and testing databases and Postgres for production. View the application in action at [shrouded-oasis-62100.herokuapp.com](shrouded-oasis-62100.herokuapp.com).
